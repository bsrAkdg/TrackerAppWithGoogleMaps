** There are two ways of using Google maps in your app. The first one is using MapView, the second one is MapFragment.
Google Map has its own lifecycle. If you use a MapView in a fragment you have to worry about your Google Map Lifecycle.
However, if you use a MapFragment you shouldn't worry about lifecycle of MapView.
